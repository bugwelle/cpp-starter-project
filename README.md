# cpp-starter-project

**This project is not finished, yet!**  
**Even if this readme says that it uses/supports X, that may not be the case, yet!**

`cpp-starter-project` is a personal starter project for modern C++ development.
Its goal is to offer a set of modern tools and resources to interested
developers (e.g. students) that want to create executable programs. This
project is not intended for creating libraries.

## Why?
I found many C++ starter projects and even more tutorials that give a
good introduction into starting new C++ and [CMake][cmake] projects but none
of them were either up-to-date (speaking C++17 and CMake >= 3.12) or had all
features that I'd like to have like package managers or continuous integration.


## Features
This project aims to be a full-fledged entry point for new medium-sized projects.  
Following features are included:

 - [x] project structure common to C++ projects (similar to [pitchfork][pf])
 - [x] modern C++ (currently C++17)
 - [x] modern CMake >= 3.12
     (no more `include_directories(...)` or `link_libraries(...)`)
 - [x] testing framework ([Catch2][catch2])
 - [x] user documentation using [Doxygen][doxygen] and [Sphinx][sphinx]
 - [x] documentation using [Doxygen][doxygen] and [Sphinx][sphinx]
 - [x] [GitHub Pages][ghpages] on `gh-pages` branch
 - [x] code formatting because no one has got time for that in code reviews
     ([`clang-format`][clangfmt] and [`cmake-format`][cmakefmt])
 - [x] static code analysis tools like linters
     ([`cppcheck`](cppcheck), [`clang-tidy`][clangtidy], [`shellcheck`][shcheck])
 - [x] continuous integration: useful not only for pull requests
     ([Travis CI][travis], [AppVeyor][appveyor], [GitLab CI][gitlabci])
 - [ ] continuous deployment
     ([Bintray][bintray]), [GitHub Pages][githubpg])
 - [x] code coverage using [Codecov][codecov]
 - [x] third-party package management using [conan][conan]
 - [ ] CPack script for packaging
